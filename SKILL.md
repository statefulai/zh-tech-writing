description: Audit, structure, draft, or revise Simplified Chinese technical documents such as design notes, RFCs, architecture explanations, and technical reviews. Use when the user is working on a document and wants clearer structure, less promotional or AI-patterned Chinese, stronger evidence boundaries, or faithful technical writing from supplied facts. Do not use to analyze code, commits, or diffs directly, generate source-derived technical reports, or handle marketing copy, UI copy, creative writing, pure translation, or non-technical humanization.

# ZH Tech Writing

Help authors produce clear, restrained, evidence-aware Simplified Chinese technical documents without changing their technical meaning.

## Choose the mode from the request

- **Audit** is the default for document requests such as “看看这份文档”, “分析文档结构”, “审一下”, “不改”, or “等我确认”. Inspect and report; do not rewrite files or create replacement drafts.
- **Structure** applies when the user asks for an outline, information architecture, section reordering, or a document skeleton. Reuse only supplied facts and mark missing decisions.
- **Draft** applies when the user asks to write a new technical document from supplied facts, code, notes, or decisions. Produce usable prose for known material and mark factual or decision gaps instead of filling them.
- **Revise** applies only when the user explicitly asks to rewrite, polish, humanize, or edit. Preserve protected content and make the minimum effective change.

Do not invent missing technical decisions, evidence, results, implementation details, ownership, or acceptance status in any mode.

Authorization to audit or propose structure does not authorize file edits, commits, publication, or external messages.

## Work evidence-first

1. Identify the document's audience, decision, scope, and current evidence.
2. Separate facts from interpretation, recommendation, and unresolved decisions.
3. Preserve the strength of every claim. Never treat proposed, implemented, deployed, observed, and verified behavior as interchangeable.
4. Put concrete actors, components, actions, constraints, failure behavior, and evidence before abstract value claims.
5. Ask only when a missing answer would materially change the document. Consolidate necessary questions instead of interrupting section by section.

Read [references/technical-structure.md](references/technical-structure.md) when evaluating, drafting, or reorganizing a document. Read [references/style-and-evidence.md](references/style-and-evidence.md) when auditing, drafting, or revising language and claim strength.

## Protect technical content

Unless the user explicitly authorizes a semantic change, preserve:

- numbers, dates, units, identifiers, and named versions;
- code blocks, commands, configuration, schemas, and API examples;
- tables, links, citations, and the claims they support;
- domain terms, uncertainty, exclusions, ownership, and responsibility boundaries.

Do not silently fix a suspected technical error. Flag it for confirmation.

## Handle sensitive material

Private authoring and public publication are different operations. Do not genericize or redact a private technical document merely because this Skill is open source.

When the requested output will be published, shared externally, or added to this Skill's repository, read [references/publication-safety.md](references/publication-safety.md). Never copy private source material into examples or evals. Use synthetic fixtures instead.

## Write natural technical Chinese

- Prefer direct subjects and verbs over abstract nouns and slogan-like conclusions.
- Remove a transition or framing sentence when deleting it loses no information.
- Treat words such as “赋能”, “闭环”, “底座”, “打造”, and “重塑” as review signals, not forbidden words. Keep them only when the document defines the actor, action, object, and observable result.
- Use lists for genuinely parallel facts or steps; use prose for explanation and trade-offs.
- Keep terminology stable. Do not rotate synonyms merely to sound varied.
- Do not add colloquialisms, emojis, personal anecdotes, or deliberate imperfections to simulate human writing.

## Output by mode

### Audit

Return:

1. a direct verdict;
2. evidence grouped by structure, language, and claim strength;
3. no more than five must-fix items when blockers exist;
4. unresolved decisions only when they materially affect the document.

Do not provide a full rewritten document unless the user asks for one.

### Structure

Return the proposed section order, each section's purpose, and a mapping from existing material to the new structure. Mark gaps instead of filling them with invented content.

### Draft

Return a usable first draft based on supplied facts. Keep `[待确认]` or an equivalent explicit marker for missing decisions that block a complete section. Do not expose internal reasoning or fabricate connective claims merely to make the document look finished.

### Revise

Return the revised text or apply the authorized edit. Report any claim-strength risk that cannot be resolved without changing meaning. Leave already clear passages alone.

## Final checks

- No new facts, causality, metrics, results, or ownership claims were introduced.
- Proposed work was not presented as implemented; implementation was not presented as deployment; deployment was not presented as runtime proof or UAT.
- Protected technical content and citation binding remain intact.
- Headings help readers locate decisions, boundaries, mechanisms, risks, and verification.
- Every strong conclusion has nearby evidence or is explicitly labeled as a recommendation.
- Read-only requests produced no file, Git, configuration, publication, or installation mutation.
